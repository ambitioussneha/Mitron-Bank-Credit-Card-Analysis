Problem Statement: 
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. So, they teamed up with AtliQ Data Services to design a dashboard and to provide actionable insights that helps them in tailoring the credit cards to the customer needs and market trends.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:
Mitron Bank is gearing up to launch a brand-new set of credit cards. I delved into a dataset of 4000 customers for the Codebasics Resume Challenge 8 to unveil some fascinating insights.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:
1. Customer Preferences: Explored age groups and payment preferences crucial for tailoring the ideal credit card in our imaginary world. 
2. Income Insights: Uncovered income details, discovering that Mumbai leads in earnings and IT employees are the highest earners.
3. Spending Patterns: Identified peak spending times and what customers spend on – vital for our imaginary bank's strategy. 
4. Income Utilization: Discovered how people use their money, revealing that IT employees maximize their spending.

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀:
This project has been incredibly interesting! Here's a snapshot of my involvement:
• Worked on Customer Segmentation to understand diverse groups.
• Identified customer preferences and market trends.
• Assessed Risks associated with different customer segments.
• Explored Customer Acquisition Cost to optimize marketing strategies.

This project gave me a better understanding of how banks work. It's interesting to see how they make credit card rules based on what people like and want in real life.
